# Git-homework

## From the 1st BSA lesson
#### The idea of the way I managed this lesson:
  1. Take a random text from a [book text finder](https://nocover.ru/).
  2. In [first one](https://github.com/RAYDENFilipp/Git-homework/blob/master/%D0%9A%D0%B5%D0%BD%20%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%20-%20%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%20%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%BC%20%D0%B3%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC.md) hide a character's name before Repository init.
  3. Add this file to the repository and complete it in a git-way:
     + reveal the character's name;
     + shortened the text width;
     + changed the text name and it's extension for better GitHUB use.
   
  4. So [the second text](https://github.com/RAYDENFilipp/Git-homework/blob/master/%D0%96%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B5%20%D0%A1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%20%E2%80%94%20%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9%20%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%82.md) was done, except only that no characters name
  wasn't changed.


#### Tools used:
1. GitHUB
2. Git Bash
3. Git GUI
